# House Price Prediction with ML.NET

## Overview

House Price Prediction with ML.NET is a .NET application that utilizes machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on various features such as size, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and more. The project leverages the power of ML.NET, a machine learning framework for .NET, to build and deploy predictive models.

## Key Features

- **Machine Learning Model:** Train a machine learning model capable of predicting house prices.
- **Linear Regression Algorithm:** Utilize a linear regression algorithm for accurate price prediction.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance using industry-standard metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2).
- **Model Persistence:** Save the trained model to a file for future use, ensuring persistence and reusability.
- **Command-Line Interface:** Implement a user-friendly command-line interface for streamlined model training and prediction.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (version 6.0 or higher)

### Dataset

To get started, you'll need a dataset containing house-related data. You can download the dataset from the following link:

[House Price Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/housing-prices-dataset)

Once downloaded, please ensure that you properly rename the dataset file according to your project requirements.

## Usage
